## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and a package manager installed on your machine.
* **Node.js** (v18.x or later recommended)
* **npm**, **yarn**, or **pnpm**

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/blueberries-films.git](https://github.com/your-username/blueberries-films.git)

    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    This project requires Firebase configuration keys to connect to the backend.

    * Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project.
    * Copy the contents of `.env.example` (or the block below) into your new `.env.local` file.
    * Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase project keys. You can find these in your Firebase project settings.

    **.env.local**
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="YOUR_SENDER_ID"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="YOUR_APP_ID"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
